# NEAT-Car-Simulation
A Python-based car simulation that uses the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to evolve neural networks for autonomous vehicle control. The simulation is built with pygame and neat-python, allowing cars to navigate a 2D environment while optimizing their performance through generations.
